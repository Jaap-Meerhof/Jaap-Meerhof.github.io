I wanted to use an esp32 with this project which in hindsight was not the best move per se. To switch the alarm on and off I used a mosfet (IRLZ44N) which worked quite well. The power is supplied by a 2 amp 12 volt powersupply, maybe a usb-C PD board could have been more beautiful to integrate. The esp32 also gets its power from this 12 volt powersupply, only through a 5 volt buck converter. I deemed this to be a bit more safer then just jamming the 12 volt in the esp even though I read this could be possible on some boards. Its got an on off switch on both sides; one for the whole alarm, the other for just the alarm light. The temperature and the message type \u0026amp; alarm message string is displayed on the screen. The case was made in FreeCAD using an parametric design. To reduce wear and tear on the gears of the alarm, it now slowly speeds up and down.\nfuture work # I want to use it now in my home, the firmware is a really annoying to get right. After a new linux install i lost i found that some libraries changed a bit.

I investigated the privacy challenges in applying Gradient Boosted Decision Trees in a Federated setting. With the main question being: is your personal health data safe when this data is used in machine learning models where the different parties train together.\nFederated Learning # The RIVM is investigating the viability of using federated learning for a data set that is currently being standardized between hospitals. Different hospitals will carry the same features, for example age, sex and medicine used will be stored for different patients on different hospitals. The hospitals and other health organizations can collaboratively create one model on this standardized data set. Federated Learning could be the Perfect solution for this problem.\nXGBoost # XGBoost is a quite new Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm which builds upon the concept of GBDTs by adding extra regularization parameters and other computational speedups. There are algorithms to use XGBoost in federated settings by numerous papers. Check my paper (grade=8.0) or GitHub.\nResults # I was able to create an attack that used extra information retrieved during training to create an attack that was stronger than a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; attack.\n","date":"25 June 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/master/","section":"Projects","summary":"For my master thisis I worked at the RIVM (National Dutch Institute for Health and Nature).","title":"Master Thesis","type":"projects"},{"content":"I always wanted to have my own website, however I did not want to deal with the front-end as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML coding is not something I enjoy as much as doing back-end work.\nHugo # This website was made using Hugo, a framework made using Go.

Control your own data! What is the JaapCloud1.0? # The \u0026ldquo;JaapCloud1.x\u0026rdquo; is mostly tasked with hosting my personal Nextcloud Instance. It also hosts a discord bot on the side, and is used for testing for future projects.\nHardware # M.2 -\u0026gt; USB adapter Raspberry Pi 4 LD3007MS Fan Official Raspberry Pi power supply 32GB micro-USB 1TB Samsung 980 1TB M.2 Software # Nextcloud Discord Music Bot Pros and Cons # Pros # Energy Efficient: The Pi is highly energy efficient mainly due to its ARM processor and efficient design. I have to buy a watt meter, but I suspect it requires about 4 to 10 Watts depending on the load. Something difficult to achieve with an x86 processor (although modern chips are remarkably good now). Cheap: I was able to get the board cheaply through the University Store as they have priority in shipping, M.2 SDD\u0026rsquo;s are getting really cheap nowadays (60 euros right now). Cons # Reliability: using a M.2 and Micro SD is not really reliable and I have to anticipate that they can break. No redundancy: currently the M.2 is run in RAID0 Weak computational power: the Pi 4 is a powerful single-board computer that is capable of hosting my Nextcloud instance. The speed of my instance could however be a bit better with more computational power, and the lack of CPU power is felt in some of the more heavy tasks. On to JaapCloud2.0 # The JaapCloud2.0 will be the successor of the JaapCloud1.0. Features will be:\nPower efficient: I want low power usage on idle, so no old x86 chips and sketchy hardware with unprofessional firmware! Mini-ATX boards are more power efficient than their ATX counterparts ECC Memory: the Pi 4 has ECC memory, this is something I want to keep as I want a reliable professional setup. Automatic Backups: currenty backups are done manually about every month (not that great but better than before as I had no backups before). Ansible deployment: using Ansible is a bit overkill, but I want to learn Ansible. It will also allow friends and other people on the internet to quickly deploy a similar setup to mine. Redundancy: as of writing this I\u0026rsquo;m not that knowledgeable on modern redundancy strategies, but from what I understand acquiring redundant parity drives should be easy with TrueNAS or UNRAID. TODO: more research Powerful future proof CPU: I\u0026rsquo;m still on the hunt for the best CPU within my price range that support ECC memory. AMD seems like the best option however as Intel locks ECC memory on most of their CPU\u0026rsquo;s to make more money by selling the chips as \u0026ldquo;enterprise XEON\u0026rdquo; chips. Tiered Caching: If HDD\u0026rsquo;s are still economically viable compared to M.2 drives, then I want to have some sort of tiered caching using M.2 drives to get a more responsive Nextcloud instance.
